# spring_projects
Sample Java applications developped in Spring framework by using Maven, JDK 8 and 11 and different repositories like:

  - Spring Web
  - Spring Data JPA
  - MySQL Driver
  - H2 Database
  - Validation
  - Spring Boot DevTools
  - Thymeleaf
  - Lombok

Some of them have been written either in Visual Studio Code or in Intelij Idea, but certain have been written in a very
"old-school" way: by using Ubuntu's Nano or VIM tex editor.
